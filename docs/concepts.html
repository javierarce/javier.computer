      <p>Under the Chatham House Rule, anyone who comes to a meeting is free to use information from the discussion, but is not allowed to reveal who made any comment. It is designed to increase openness of discussion. The rule is a system for holding debates and discussion panels on controversial topics, named after the headquarters of the UK Royal Institute of International Affairs, based in Chatham House, London, where the rule originated in June 1927.</p>

      <div class="Post__title">Code-switching</div>
      <p>In linguistics, code-switching or language alternation occurs when a speaker alternates between two or more languages, or language varieties, in the context of a single conversation. Multilinguals, speakers of more than one language, sometimes use elements of multiple languages when conversing with each other. Thus, code-switching is the use of more than one linguistic variety in a manner consistent with the syntax and phonology of each variety.</p>

      <p>The Droste effect (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈdrɔstə]), known in art as an example of mise en abyme, is the effect of a picture recursively appearing within itself, in a place where a similar picture would realistically be expected to appear, creating a loop which theoretically could go on forever, but realistically only goes on as far as the image’s quality allows.</p>

      <div class="Post__title">Ergodicity</div>
      <p>In mathematics, ergodicity expresses the idea that a point of a moving system, either a dynamical system or a stochastic process, will eventually visit all parts of the space that the system moves in, in a uniform and random sense. This implies that the average behavior of the system can be deduced from the trajectory of a “typical” point.</p>

<p>Equivalently, a sufficiently large collection of random samples from a process can represent the average statistical properties of the entire process. Ergodicity is a property of the system; it is a statement that the system cannot be reduced or factored into smaller components.</p>

      <p>In phonetics, ingressive sounds are sounds by which the airstream flows inward through the mouth or nose. The three types of ingressive sounds are lingual ingressive or velaric ingressive (from the tongue and the velum), glottalic ingressive (from the glottis), and pulmonic ingressive (from the lungs).</p>

      <div class="Post__title">La perruque</div>
      <p>The French idiom la perruque (the wig) was conceived of by theoretician Michel de Certeau. In France, this expression refers to the work one does for oneself under the guise of doing work for their employer. For instance, performing la perruque could be as simple as the office worker using the company’s computer to write personal letters during office hours. “The worker who indulges in la perruque actually diverts time”…which “differs from pilfering in that nothing of material value is stolen”.</p>

<p>De Certeau commented that this subversive act or “tactic” became so common place that it quickly spread to all other areas of society, including the arts and culture.</p>

      <p>A tontine (/ˈtɒntaɪn, -iːn, ˌtɒnˈtiːn/) is an investment plan for raising capital, devised in the 17th century and relatively widespread in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>

<p>It enables subscribers to share the risk of living a long life by combining features of a group annuity with a kind of mortality lottery. Each subscriber pays an agreed sum into the fund and thereafter receives a periodical payout. As members die, their payout entitlements devolve to the other participants, and so the value of each continuing payout increases. On the death of the last member, the scheme is wound up.</p>
