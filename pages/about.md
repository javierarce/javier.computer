My name is [Javier Arce](/me), <em>comme tout le monde</em>. I'm very into: [making things online](/projects)
[photographing](/photos), [reading](/books), [drawing](https://drawings.javierarce.com), and [watching movies](/movies).

I get sad when I only spend my time consuming instead of making things. This
online place is my attempt to spend more time thinking, documenting, and making.

This website contains a wiki, several blog posts, a collection of silly songs,
a pun, a hidden passage to another dimension, a ghost story, a list of dog names,
a list of names that are not dog names, references to my early memories, several photos of
myself eating ice cream, a mirror, a coin, a yellow bird, a photo of your turtle, a
turtle.
