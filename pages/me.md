### About me

- Since 2021 I work as a designer at [Automattic](https://automattic.com)
- Before that, I was paid to code.
- In my time as a programmer, I blocked the security system of the site where I worked to get several dinosaur embryos, which caused the perimeter fences to lose power and wait because I think I have described something that happens in Jurassic Park.
- I have not eaten meat since the beginning of 2017.
- I still eat fish from time to time.
- I studied German for three years and spent one in Frankfurt with an Erasmus scholarship.
- I lived in Amsterdam for two rainy years and another four in Barcelona.
- <s>I have been living in Madrid for 10 years.</s>
- I now live (again) in Barcelona.
- I would like to live in Berlin.
- My favorite author is Georges Perec.
- The movie I have seen the most times is Children of Men.
- I am unable to read the time on an analog clock at a reasonable speed.
- ~~For 11 years I have kept this playlist where I put my favorite songs.~~ [I quit Spotify](/2021/08/08/sunday), sorry.
- A few years back I worked designing book covers.
- I don't feel very comfortable looking at some of those covers.
- I'm interested in experimental and folk games, [book covers](https://www.are.na/javier/i-ve-got-you-covered), and [zines](https://www.are.na/javier/zine-idmgeajhfcs).
- For the past three years I have organized a festival of computational literature called [Poetry Slash](https://poetryslash.com).
