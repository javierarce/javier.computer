Two days later, I published <a href="https://x.com/javier/status/1851548924437250374">a follow-up</a>
    explaining that I recovered my account. I've edited the text on this page to fix the grammar and add links.</div>

<p>Alright, let me share the full story of how my 14-year-old
<a href="https://instagram.com">Instagram</a> account, @javier, was stolen and ended up in
the hands of a hip-hop producer—and why I believe it was an inside job.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>First off, here’s some backstory: I’ve had the
<a href="https://instagram.com/javier">@javier</a> username since October 2010, the same
month the app launched. I joined so early, that I even have emails reporting
bugs to <a href="https://x.com/joshriedel">@joshriedel</a>, Instagram’s very first
employee.</p>

<p>Over the past 14 years, I’ve received countless messages to buy my account.
Early on, I made a conscious decision not to engage with these requests. Rather
than blocking people, I simply ignored them or restricted their accounts when
that feature became available.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I even created a quick iMovie compilation of some of the
messages I received in 2018. Since then, the volume of messages has only
increased.</p>

<p>I’ve keep taking screenshots of everyone who’s asked about acquiring my
account. One interesting pattern: the majority of these requests come from
profiles without any photos. I find it so weird that people are so eager to get
a username when they don’t even share content!</p>

<h3 id="the-theft">The Theft</h3>

<p>Alright, back to the story. On Wednesday, October 23rd, around 7 PM Spanish
time, after I got killed for the thousandth time in Elden Ring, I opened
Instagram and found myself logged out.</p>

<p>While I’d occasionally received notifications about suspicious activity
requiring identity verification, this was different—a complete logout. When I
saw this, I knew my worst fear had finally become reality: I had lost my
Instagram account.</p>

<p>When I attempted to log back in, my password was rejected. Using the password
recovery option, I discovered something alarming: the email associated with my
account had been changed to an address I didn’t recognize:
r*******e@gmail.com</p>

<p>At this point, my <a href="https://instagram.com/javier">@javier</a> account still
displayed all my content, but I knew this wouldn’t last long. I tried
Instagram’s hacked account reporting page, but it was ineffective: when I
entered my username the page simply reloaded without any confirmation.</p>

    </div>
    <button class="fullscreen-button" aria-label="Fullscreen"></button>
  </div>
  
</div>
<p>After exhausting all recovery methods, I refreshed my now-inaccessible account
to find all my content replaced by 4 posts. Here’s my account before and after
the robbery.</p>

<p>The hackers had moved my content to a new account, @javier.typeshi, stripped of
my profile photo and description, ironically adding the text “meta official”.</p>

<p>The profile picture in that account belongs to a man also named Javier Arce. He
was a journalist that worked for @azcentral <a href="https://eu.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2024/09/06/javier-arce-la-voz-and-arizona-republic-journalist-dies-at-age-48/75106323007">who sadly passed away from stomach cancer last month</a>.</p>

<p>Before turning to Twitter for help (where I was flooded with recovery scams), I
created a new account to request my content back. They never responded. I knew
the chances were pretty low, and that they would probably try to extort me, but
hey I had to ask.</p>

<h3 id="the-investigation">The Investigation</h3>

<p>Ok, before I move on and tell you about the new owner of the account, let’s do
some conspirancy talk and let me explain how I think my account was stolen.</p>

<p>My account was well-protected with 2FA and linked to a unique, private email
address that I’d never shared. I use 1Password and am extremely careful about
security. I’ve never entered my Instagram credentials on any third-party
websites or apps, nor have I ever shared 2FA codes.</p>

<p>On the day of the event, I received no email or phone notification about any
unusual access attempts. So here’s what I believe it happened: it wasn’t a
phising attack, it was somebody from inside the company.</p>

<p>This wouldn’t be unprecedented. <a href="https://www.cshub.com/attacks/news/meta-fires-employees-for-allegedly-hacking-into-users-accounts">Meta has previously fired employees for
hacking user
accounts</a>,
and there’s a thriving black market for usernames on forums like
<a href="https://oguser.com">oguser.com</a></p>

<h3 id="the-new-owner">The New Owner</h3>

<p>Back to the story. Let me tell you about the new account owner. His name is
Javier “Jay” Sang. Looking at the tagged photos, he seems to be the founder and
CEO of a label called Rebel Music.</p>

    </div>
</div>
<p>And do you remember how I take a screenshot of every account that ask me to
sell or change my username? Jay did that in April this year. It seems he may
have sought alternative means after I didn’t respond to his request lol</p>

<h3 id="current-status">Current Status</h3>

<p>As for the current situation: so far, I’ve regained control of the renamed
account with all my content and messages, but I still haven’t recovered my
original username.</p>

<p>I’m receiving help from an Instagram employee, and through my network of
friends and their connections I’ve made contact with other folks at the company
who have expressed interest in my case and offered their assistance. I’m very
grateful for that.</p>

<p>In fact, I doubt I would have been able to recover my content without those
connections at the company. This highlights a serious issue that Instagram and
Meta need to address in their account recovery process.</p>

<p>And I’m not the only person with this problem. A few days ago, I learned that
<a href="https://twitter.com/joao">@joao</a>, another long-time user, also lost his
Instagram handle in a similar way last year, and he still hasn’t heard back
from Instagram.</p>

<p>For reasons unknown to me, regaining access to my content was easy, but
reclaiming my original username is much harder. And while I’m optimistic about
getting my old username back, I’m sure this won’t be the last hack attempt on
my account.</p>

<p>The end. Thanks for reading this far! If you’re wondering how you can help, I’d
appreciate it if you shared this thread. And if you know
<a href="https://x.com/mosseri">@mosseri</a>, please let him know one of Instagram’s
earliest users is frustrated and thinking of leaving.</p>

<h3 id="good-news">Good News</h3>

<p>Hey, guess what? I’m back on Instagram! Huge thanks to everyone who helped me
recover my account, shared or liked this thread, or reached out to me over
these past few days!</p>

<p>While sadly I can’t help others recover their accounts or ask the people who
assisted me (since they don’t work in support), I hope this thread gives some
visibility to the issue and encourages others to share their stories.</p>

<p>To me, all of this is a perfect reminder of the importance of controlling your
content and building networks outside the reach of proprietary platforms.</p>

<p>There’s <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/posse">an excellent post</a> by <a href="https://www.mollywhite.net">Molly
White</a> about POSSE (Publish on your Own Site,
Syndicate Elsewhere) that I encourage everyone to read and share.</p>

<p>And if you don’t have a blog, consider starting one today! Creating a blog is
easier than ever, and it’s one of the best ways to control your content, share
your ideas, and build meaningful networks outside of traditional platforms.</p>

<p>For me, I’ll keep posting stories on Instagram and connecting with my friends
there, but I’ll also be doubling down on publishing <a href="https://javier.computer">on my personal
blog</a> and on the <a href="https://mastodon.social/@javierarce">Fediverse</a>.</p>

<p>See you there!</p>
