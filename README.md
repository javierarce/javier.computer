Hi, stranger! Welcome to my little computer on the net!

This website contains a wiki, several blog posts, a collection of silly songs, a pun, a hidden passage to another dimension, a list of dog names, a list of names that are not dog names, references to my early memories, several photos of myself eating ice cream, a coin, a yellow bird, a photo of your turtle, a turtle.

I get sad when I spend my time consuming instead of making things. This website is my attempt to spend more time thinking, documenting, and making.
