A tontine (/ˈtɒntaɪn, -iːn, ˌtɒnˈtiːn/) is an investment plan for raising capital, devised in the 17th century and relatively widespread in the 18th and 19th centuries.

It enables subscribers to share the risk of living a long life by combining features of a group annuity with a kind of mortality lottery. Each subscriber pays an agreed sum into the fund and thereafter receives a periodical payout. As members die, their payout entitlements devolve to the other participants, and so the value of each continuing payout increases. On the death of the last member, the scheme is wound up.
