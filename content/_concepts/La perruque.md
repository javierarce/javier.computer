The French idiom la perruque (the wig) was conceived of by theoretician Michel de Certeau. In France, this expression refers to the work one does for oneself under the guise of doing work for their employer. For instance, performing la perruque could be as simple as the office worker using the company's computer to write personal letters during office hours. "The worker who indulges in la perruque actually diverts time"â€¦which "differs from pilfering in that nothing of material value is stolen".

De Certeau commented that this subversive act or "tactic" became so common place that it quickly spread to all other areas of society, including the arts and culture.
