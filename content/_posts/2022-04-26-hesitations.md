> Many people don’t want to quit because they worry: without my Twitter account,
who will listen to me? In what way will I matter to the world beyond my
apartment, my office, my family? I believe these hesitations reveal something
totally unrelated to Twitter. I don’t have words for it, exactly, but if you
find yourself fretting in this way, I will gently suggest that it’s worth
questing a bit inside yourself to discover what you’re *really* worried about.
