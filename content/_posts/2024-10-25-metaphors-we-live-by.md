> “Try to imagine a culture where arguments are not viewed in terms of war, where
> no one wins or loses, where there is no sense of attacking or defending,
> gaining or losing ground. Imagine a culture where an argument is viewed as a
> dance, the participants are seen as performers, and the goal is to perform in a
> balanced and aesthetically pleasing way. In such a culture, people would view
> arguments differently, experience them differently, carry them out differently,
> and talk about them differently. But we would probably not view them as arguing
> at all: they would simply be doing something different. It would seem strange
> even to call what they were doing ‘arguing’.
