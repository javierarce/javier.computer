> I don’t like myself very much, so I try not to observe myself too often. I made a documentary once entitled Talking Heads. I asked people two questions: “Who are you?” and “What do you want?” Afterwards, I asked myself those questions. I realized that I didn’t have any answers. I don’t know who I am and I don’t know what I want. If anything, I’d like some peace and quiet, but I’ve never achieved it, and I probably never will. So I will never have what I really want.

HBD, Kieślowski
