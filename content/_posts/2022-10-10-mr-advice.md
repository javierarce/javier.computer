> Having a good time will also likely mean your games are strange - misshapen,
erratic, half-formed, weirdly over- and under-developed at the same time. You
will have to mutilate your way through the canon of design. A lot of the things
you take for granted about the form will turn out to be boring, or hard to
implement, or not fit with your own process, or you might feel like chopping
them out for whatever other reason. Meanwhile the most trivial things can grab
your attention, draw you in. I think that's fine. I don't think anybody needs
more well-balanced games - that's the worst of all backhanded compliments, next
to "diligent".
