"At the end of the exhibition, [the image of Melly](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLMqYVeKZCT) was taken down and the Witte de With staff received several telephone calls and a number of written protest messages demanding Melly’s reinstatement. Asked by Witte de With curators and staff why it was important for Melly Shum to return to the corner at Witte de Withstraat and Boomgaardstraat, several callers reasoned that every city needs a monument to hating one’s job."
