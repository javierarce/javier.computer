          <ul>

            <li>My name is Javier Arce, <em>comme tout le monde</em>.</li>
            <li>I like to write, draw, read, photography and do silly things on the Internet. My vital goal is to retire to do this all the time.</li>
            <li>I work as a designer at Automattic. Before that I was paid to code (CARTO, Vizzuality).</li>
            <li>In my time as a programmer, I blocked the security system of the site where
              I worked to get several dinosaur embryos, which caused the perimeter fences
              to lose power and wait because I think I have described something that happens in Jurassic Park.</li>
            <li>I have not eaten meat since the beginning of 2017, but I cannot consider myself completely vegetarian because I occasionally eat fish.</li>
            <li>I lived in Amsterdam for two rainy years and another four in Barcelona.</li>
            <li>I would like to live in Berlin.</li>
            <li>My favorite author is Georges Perec.</li>
            <li>The movie I have seen the most times is Children of Men.</li>
            <li>I am unable to read the time on an analog clock at a reasonable speed.</li>
            <li>I was born in León.</li>
            <li>I have been living in Madrid for 8 years.</li>
            <li>I have kept <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7vqFM7WRxeDHdsDMmGntuR?si=7QmZdWLASguzxwpwxLS0jQ" title="I like to listen to this playlist" target="_blank">a playlist</a> for 10 years where I keep my favorite songs.</li>
            <li>I studied German for three years and spent one in Frankfurt as Erasmus.</li>
            <li>A few years back I worked designing book covers.</li>
            <li>I don't feel very comfortable looking at some of those covers.</li>
            <li>I'm interested in <a href="https://www.are.na/javier/games-people-play" title="Games People Play — Experimental, weird, folk, and casual
                games" target="_blank">experimental and folk games</a>, <a href="https://www.are.na/javier/i-ve-got-you-covered" target="_blank">book covers</a>, and <a href="https://www.are.na/javier/zine-idmgeajhfcs" title="Zines" target="_blank">zines</a>.
            </li>
            <li>For the past three  years I have organized a festival of computational literature called <a href="https://poetryslash.com" target="_blank">Poetry Slash</a>. In 2020, for obvious and pandemic reasons, the event was canceled.</li>

          </ul>
