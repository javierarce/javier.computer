### About this and that

Hi, stranger! Welcome to my little computer on the net!

This website contains a wiki, several blog posts, a collection of silly songs,
a pun, a hidden passage to another dimension, a ghost story, a list of dog names, a list of names
that are not dog names, references to my early memories, several photos of
myself eating ice cream, a mirror, a coin, a yellow bird, a photo of your turtle, a
turtle.

I get sad when I only spend my time consuming instead of making things. This website
is my attempt to spend more time thinking, documenting, and making.
