### About this and that

Hi, stranger! Welcome to [my](/me) little computer on the net!

This website contains a wiki, several blog posts, a collection of silly songs,
a pun, a hidden passage to another dimension, a list of dog names, a list of names
that are not dog names, references to my early memories, several photos of
myself eating ice cream, a coin, a yellow bird, a photo of your turtle, a
turtle.

I get sad when I spend my time consuming instead of making things. This website
is my attempt to spend more time thinking, documenting, and making.

If you like what you see here, why don't you [let me know](https://mail.javier.computer)?
