### About this website


Hi, stranger, welcome to my computer on the net.

This website contains a wiki, several blog posts, a collection of silly jokes, a hidden passage to another dimension, a list of dog names, a list of names that are not dog names, several photos of myself eating ice cream, a coin, a yellow bird, a photo of your turtle, a turtle.

I'm my worst self when I spend my time consuming instead of making. This website is my attempt to spend less time consuming and more time thinking and making.

If you like what you see here, why don't you [let me know](https://mail.javier.computer/)?

### About me

- My name is Javier Arce, <em>comme tout le monde</em>.
- I like to write, draw, read, take photos, and do silly things on the Internet. My goal is to retire to do these things fulltime.
- Since 2021 I work as a designer at Automattic.
- Before that, I was paid to code.
- In my time as a programmer, I blocked the security system of the site where I worked to get several dinosaur embryos, which caused the perimeter fences to lose power and wait because I think I have described something that happens in Jurassic Park.
- I have not eaten meat since the beginning of 2017.
- I still eat fish from time to time.
- I lived in Amsterdam for two rainy years and another four in Barcelona.
- <s>I have been living in Madrid for 10 years.</s>
- I now live (again) in Barcelona.
- I would like to live in Berlin.
- My favorite author is <strong>Georges Perec</strong>.
- The movie I have seen the most times is <strong>Children of Men</strong>.
- I am unable to read the time on an analog clock at a reasonable speed
- For 11 years I have kept this <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7vqFM7WRxeDHdsDMmGntuR?si=7QmZdWLASguzxwpwxLS0jQ" title="I like to listen to this playlist" target="_blank">playlist</a> where I put my favorite songs.
- I studied German for three years and spent one in Frankfurt with an Erasmus scholarship.
- A few years back I worked designing book covers.
- I don't feel very comfortable looking at some of those covers.
- I'm interested in experimental and folk games, <a href="https://www.are.na/javier/i-ve-got-you-covered" target="_blank">book covers</a>, and <a href="https://www.are.na/javier/zine-idmgeajhfcs" title="Zines" target="_blank">zines</a>.
- For the past three  years I have organized a festival of computational literature called <a href="https://poetryslash.com" target="_blank">Poetry Slash</a>. In 2020, for obvious and pandemic reasons, the event was canceled.
