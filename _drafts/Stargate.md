Thanks, @Anjana! 

I just have a couple of questions to start: 

- Per this [post](https://dotorgmarcomms.wordpress.com/2022/03/09/self-service-tools-for-social-post-creation/)I understand that you all want to work with Canva, right? If that's the case, I think I could deliver the designs using Figma and then help you to import them there. Even if you don't end up using Figma, I'd recommend to use that file as the "**single source of truth**".
- Is there a list of social media assets that you'd like me to start with? I could probably revisit the work Santana and I did for the special episode of WP Briefing and start from there, but if you had a list of things you'll need that would be super helpful.
